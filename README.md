# HAPPY-OR-SAD-MOOD-DETECTION-CNN-PROJECT

Happy or Sad Mood Detection
This project aims to detect whether a person is in a happy or sad mood based on their facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled as either happy or sad and can accurately classify new images into one of these two categories.

Overview
Facial expressions are a powerful way to infer a person's emotional state. This project leverages the power of CNNs to analyze facial images and classify them into two mood categories: happy or sad. The model is trained to recognize patterns and features that distinguish these moods.

Dataset
The dataset consists of facial images labeled as either happy or sad. The images are preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets. The dataset can be found in the data directory of this repository.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/happy-sad-mood-detection.git
cd happy-sad-mood-detection
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the Data:

Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and located in the data directory.
Run the preprocess.py script to preprocess the data.
bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Train the Model:

Train the CNN model using the train.py script.
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluate the Model:

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluate.py script.
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images using the predict.py script.
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using the following layers:

Convolutional layers
Max-pooling layers
Flattening layer
Fully connected (dense) layers
Output layer with softmax activation
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and model evaluation metrics can be found in the results directory.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN model
OpenCV: For image preprocessing
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and results
